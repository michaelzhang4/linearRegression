## About
This project is a basic linear regression on a student dataset. I sorted the dataset by numerical values and organised them into independent and dependent sets. I chose the columns 'failures', 'studytime', 'absences', 'G1' (first grade), 'G2' (second grade) as the independent values to use to predict the dependent value 'G3'. Next I split the dependent and independent sets further into training and test sets, with 90% of the data being used for training and 10% for testing. After fitting the model, the model was able to predict 70%+ of student's final grade every time with the highest prediction rate being 96%. At the end of the project I also drew a graph to visually represent the relationship between each independent value and the dependent value.
